As a famous band from the 60’s, the user who knows “The Monkees” wants to be connected back to this time - youthful, colourful and a fun feeling whilst also being connected to what is happening now. The site must support these feelings by keeping the text content simple yet informative, so that the visual images and colours support user engagement and emotional connection. For potential fans, the user will have an expectation of a band from the 60’s. The colours are bright, the text is not modern, the images are not as pixilated as normally expected from modern rock bands. Therefore, the site must conform to these standards of retro feeling, not modern looking, not animated, and no pop ups.","","It is expected that the user will be a fan from the 60’s, 70’s period. Therefore, the site must recognise age considerations, with particular consideration to sight. The text must be easy on the site, clear, large, with good spacing. The animation in the site must be limited and subtle so that it is not perceived as being aggressive. The layout of the site will be a flat-design. The reason for this is primarily because the user will find it easier use the navigation menu to scroll to the 3 section areas and know where they are.
